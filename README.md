# SKIZM_Seg_Model UNet Segmentation Model with PyTorch and COCO Dataset

This repository contains the implementation of a segmentation model using the UNet architecture, developed in PyTorch. The model is trained on the COCO Dataset 2017 for object segmentation tasks.

## Prerequisites

Before running the model, ensure that you have the following installed:
- Python 3.6 or later
- PyTorch 1.7.0 or later
- torchvision
- COCO API (pycocotools)
- matplotlib (for visualization)
- CUDA (for GPU support)

## Dataset

The model is trained on the [COCO Dataset 2017](https://cocodataset.org/#download). It includes a large set of images for object detection, segmentation, and captioning. Download and extract the dataset in the `data/` directory.

## Model Architecture

The UNet model is a convolutional neural network used for semantic segmentation. It consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path for precise localization.

## Training the Model

To train the model, run:
```
python preprocess.py --data_dir /path/to/coco/dataset --epochs 50 --batch_size 4 --learning_rate 0.001
```

Arguments:
- `--data_dir`: Path to the COCO dataset.
- `--epochs`: Number of training epochs.
- `--batch_size`: Batch size for training.
- `--learning_rate`: Learning rate for the optimizer.

## Evaluation

To evaluate the model on the validation set, run:
```
python evaluate.py --data_dir /path/to/coco/dataset --model_dir /path/to/saved/model
```

## Visualization

Use `visualize.py` to visualize the segmentation results. Example usage:
```
python visualize.py --image_path /path/to/image --model_path /path/to/model
```
